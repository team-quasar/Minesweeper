# Minesweeper Nine
Minesweeper Nine is a new form of Minesweeper! Inspired by Tetris 99, introducing Minesweeper Nine, a nine-player Minesweeper battle royale game to see who can win the fastest!
- Lan connection as of now, so if you have nine computers in a room, you can play against eachother in this hectic game!
- It is not necessary to have nine players in one game, you can have less (but not more)!
